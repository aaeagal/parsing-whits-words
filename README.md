# CS Capstone 2021: Parsing Whit's Words  
## Azeeza Eagal 

<p>
The two tools — Google Translate and William Whitaker’s Words — both aim to provide assistance
to beginning Latin students. Google Translate provides a translation of Latin sentences, but due
to algorithmic limitations, does not adhere to the correct grammar. William Whitaker’s Words, an
online Latin dictionary, provides the user with the English definition and grammar associated with
the word, but it does not form simple sentences for the user. This project aims to use the parsing
process of William Whitaker’s Words to further explain the grammar present and to create simple
sentences and phrases with the intent of aiding beginning Latin students.
